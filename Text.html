        Don't Bother Me

    <pre>
        Since she's been gone
        I want no one
        To talk to me
        It's not the same
        But I'm to blame
        It's plain to see
        So go away and leave me alone
        Don't bother me
        I can't believe
        That she would leave
        Me on my own
        It's just not right
        When every night
        I'm all alone
        I've got no time for you right now
        Don't bother me
        I know I'll never be the same
        If I don't get her back again
        Because I know she'll always be
        The only girl for me
        But 'til she's here
        Please don't come near
        Just stay away
        I'll let you know
        When she's come home
        Until that day
        Don't come around, leave me alone
        Don't bother me
        I've got no time for you right now
        Don't bother me
        I know I'll never be the same
        If I don't get her back again
        Because I know she'll always be
        The only girl for me
        But 'til she's here
        Please don't come near
        Just stay away
        I'll let you know
        When she's come home
        Until that day
        Don't come around, leave me alone
        Don't bother me
        Don't bother me
        Don't bother me
        Don't bother me
        Don't bother me
